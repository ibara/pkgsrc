UxPlay is an open source AirPlay2 Mirror server. Its main use is to
act like an AppleTV for screen-mirroring (with audio) of
iOS/iPadOS/macOS clients (iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad, Mac computers)
in a window on the server display of a host running Linux, macOS,
other Unix, or Microsoft Windows.

The UxPlay server and its client must be on the same local area
network, on which a Bonjour/Zeroconf mDNS/DNS-SD server is also
running (only DNS-SD "Service Discovery" service is strictly
necessary, it is not necessary that the local network also be of the
".local" mDNS-based type). On Linux and BSD Unix servers, this is
usually provided by Avahi, through the avahi-daemon service.
